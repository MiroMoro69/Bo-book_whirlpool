So I bought a book like "Creating a website with sliders in JS and Bootstrap"
But the promo I saw without JS and Bootstrap plunged me into a state that decent companies donâ€™t talk about.
Initially, it was intended to make a book exchange project among students. However, there was another additional goal. Share the code with the author of the book. And then the layout is tabular .... Well, they themselves understand.
